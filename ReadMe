Code-Noober-Central
Code Noober Central is a new concept gathering place for code learners to give and recieve help, support and encouragement from other code noobers along their road to becoming full fledged web developers. The concept is packed with features that will enhance users code learning experience to make it both enjoyable and uplifting, providing support and general comraderie to help motivate, boost learner self esteem and give a gentle nudge to those users who are in need of a push to the web developer finish line.

The goals of the Code Noobers Project is to  provide an encouraging, code learner atmosphere where code learners have resources presented to them for easy access....we want to stimulate them and encourage them to keep coding even when it gets tough...create a support system where if a noober is getting frustrated and down on their abilities they can send a public alert that will signal others that a noober is in distress...an environment where learners are encouraged and rewarded for boosting each other and keeping them on point, focused and heading in the right direction
